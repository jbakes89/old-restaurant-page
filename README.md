## UPDATE (6th June, 2022)
I've had to take a longer than expected break since becoming a parent. I had been making piecemeal changes while trying to maintain my studies in parallel with childcare, but it wasn't possible to commit enough time on a regular basis, and the project became disjointed. I'll be starting a new version of this project (and this one will likely be deleted eventually) now, as I hope to find regular time to study again, even if only a few hours a day.

## Description
Created as part of The Odin Project's Javascript course on the Full Stack Javascript path ([lesson page](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-javascript/courses/javascript/lessons/restaurant-page)).

The aim of this project is to learn how to structure and manage a project with multiple modules using `npm` and `webpack`.
